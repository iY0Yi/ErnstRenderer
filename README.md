# Ernst Renderer
A GLSL renderer addon for Blender.

This is a highly personal project. So, there are no documents.
I'd love to share the code with anyone interested.
If you have any questions, dm me or open issues on the repo :)

## Instructions to get started
1. Download the zip file from here.
2. Unzip and extract the contents.
3. Zip "ernst_renderer" folder. It's the addon.
4. Install it to Blender. (The 'Install from Disk' menu is hidden inside the dropdown menu under the down arrow button in the top right corner...)
5. Install "Wonder_Mesh_Legacy" addon.
6. Open "tutorial0.blend".
7. Change the viewport shading to "Rendered".
8. Edit GLSLs in the "track" folder.
9. Enjoy!
